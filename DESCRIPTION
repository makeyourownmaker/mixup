Description: The mixup method enlarges training sets using linear interpolations of features and associated labels as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412.  It produces virtual feature-target pairs from randomly drawn feature-target pairs in the training data.  The strength of interpolation is governed by a mixup hyperparameter.  The method is straight-forward and data-agnostic.  It should result in a reduction of generalisation error and may help to resist memorisation of corrupt labels.
